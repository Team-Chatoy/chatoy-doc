# Introduction

Chatoy is an instant messenger that supports both peer-to-peer mode and client-server mode.

We plan to prioritize the development of the p2p mode, while reserving the API for future expansion of the client-server mode.

## Structure

The Chatoy project is structured into the core implemented with C++ and the cross-platform UI implemented with Java, and these two parts interact via JNI.
